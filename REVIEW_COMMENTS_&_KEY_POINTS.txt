Review Points And Comments:

Review Comments and Key points on the fixes and framework created are Oredered as follows:


(1) Common and Test Class Level Review on design and errors.
(2) Framework design pattern, files placing, reusability, reporting. 


    1. Test Class Level Review on design and errors.

	(i) Common Issues:

	(a). set the path for driver before initialize the same.

	(b). create a common utility to launch driver and set chrome driver path.

	(c). create property file to input test configuration values i.e browser name, driver path other common configuration needs before test.

	(d). it is better to have test case executed via testNG xml while using testNG, hence it should be configured right.

	(e). Should try to keep the implementation for tests abstract/ hidden and reusable and add provision for further updates of the same
	     which would assure maintainability.

	(f). Assert every validation and report with screenshot for failed step/every step if possible. Since, html results
	     can be easily edited and hence for show casing tests to client is one step ahead if the tests have proper
	     evidences.
 
	(g). Must avoid using thread.sleep (hard wait of any type). Instead use explicit waits.

	(h). should follow a proper design pattern across the tests for efficient testing i.e page factory for example.

	(i). Always the tests must NOT be placed/developed in the main src folder, it should be placed in the test src folder
	     the main should only have common utils.

	(j) The classes should not be developed in "default package" it should be developed in a properly created
	    package with correct naming conventions.

	(k) The drivers can be placed in a separate relevant folder which can make the framework presentable.

	(l) Important of all a framework or automation is about reusabilty which requires reusable library for all
	    the tests.
	

(ii)FlightBookingTest:

	(a).Use explicit waits. 

	(b).Update the chrome driver to latest for supporting latest chrome versions. It can cause errors during execution.
	    such that the chrome driver which was already there caused exception when sending text to 'from' text box
	    which got fixed after updating the chrome driver.

	(c).Xpath Id for the To(destination) text box was not correct i.e the actual value for the attribute id is 'ToTag'
	    but in script the vale was'toTag' hence it throws 'NoSuchElementException.

	(d).The date picker xpath is hard coded to pick a date and not flexible which is not good for a locator. Should change the
 	    xpath in such a way that it can take any date from the user. write a common method.

	(e).Assesrtion should be done specifically whether Bangalore to New Delhi flights are shown and not just 'searchSummary' text
	    so that what gets Asserted will completley validate the scenario.


(ii)HotelBookingtest:

	(a). This class has pagefactory pattern implemented for finding elements which was missing "PageFactory.initElements()" this method
	     will implicitly call the findElement method from behind without which the script fails.

	(b). Date picker must be automated for any inputs from the user and should be reusable.


(iii)SignInTest:

	(a). Identify whether an element is within a frame i.e "SignIn" button is an element located within a frame
	     because of which the element cannot be identified unless switched to that frame.



Key Points of the framework developed and fixed

      2 Framework design pattern, files placing, reusability, reporting.

		(a). An automation framework must follow a design pattern with correct usage of OOP's concepts
	     	for better understanding, readability and reusability.
     	    
     	    The fixes made to the task does not only resolve the issues but also follows a strong "Page Abstraction/Page Factory Pattern" 
	     	with "LoadableComponent" implemented for every page i.e "FlightBookingPage.class", "HotelBookingPage.class", 
	    	"SearchSummaryPage.class", "SignInPage.class".
         
         
	    (b). Common Reusable Library "UiCommons" is used which was not present.

		(c). "DriverFactory"class is implemented for initializing driver and closing the same which can be used across
	          tests.

		(d). Input/output utilities created to read test configuration properties from ".properties" file.

		(e). Listener class implemented for running failed tests again, the number of times as user specified.

		(f). Listener class implemented for intuitive reporting with html that has screenshots attached within the html report page.
 
		(g). TestNG xml included for running as TestNG suite.
	
		(h). Proper assertion done for validation.
